## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Page shell
Every HTML page the theme renders SHALL contain, in this order:
- a skip link `a.skip-link` with `href="#main"`;
- a `header.site-header` holding, in this order:
  - `a.site-title`, linking `/` with the text `OrgSynDB`;
  - a `nav` element carrying `aria-label="Site"`, which links, in this order, to `/procedures/`, `/compounds/`, `/sequences/` and `/help/`, with the texts `Procedures`, `Compounds`, `Sequences` and `Help`. The header holds no other `nav`;
  - `form.site-search` with `role="search"` and `method="get"`, holding one `input` with `type="search"` and `name="q"`, and a `button` with `type="submit"` and the text `Search`. On the catalogue, the term pages and `/general-procedures/` it is the catalogue's search form, with the `action`, attributes and texts that site-catalogue "Catalogue controls" gives. On every other page its `action` resolves to `/procedures/`, and its input carries `aria-label="Search procedures"` and the placeholder `Product, CAS, SMILES or keyword`;
- exactly one `main` element with `id="main"`;
- a `footer.site-footer` whose text is `OrgSynDB · internal procedures · built <time>`, where `<time>` is a `time` element whose `datetime` is the time the site was built, as an RFC 3339 date-time, and whose text is that time as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. Every page of one build shows the same time.

The navigation link whose URL is the page's own URL carries `aria-current="page"`. Otherwise the link of the section the page lies in carries `aria-current="true"`: every procedure page, `/general-procedures/`, `/reaction_types/`, `/tags/`, `/authors/` and their term pages lie in `/procedures/`; every compound page lies in `/compounds/`; every sequence page lies in `/sequences/`; every help page lies in `/help/`. No other navigation link carries `aria-current`. Every page has exactly one `input` with `name="q"`: the header's.

On screen, the site title and the navigation sit at the start of the header row and the search form at its end, so that the header has the same height, and its title, navigation and search form the same positions, on every page at a given window width. Every page's `h1` has the same font size.

These texts are those of an English site; a German site has the German texts that the localization spec gives.

Each page's head has a `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` and a `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">`. The site-build "Minimal layout contract" elements also stay: `lang`, `charset` and `<title>`.

Headings follow these rules:
- Each page has exactly one `h1`.
- No heading is more than one level deeper than the heading before it.
- The `<title>` is the page's display title followed by ` | OrgSynDB`, except on the home page, whose title is `OrgSynDB`. The display title is the vocabulary label on a reaction-type term page, the tag itself on a tag term page, the interface string named by the page's `title_key` where it has one, and the page title otherwise.

#### Scenario: Shell on every page
- **WHEN** a test scans every HTML file under `public/` except files under `public/pagefind/`, after a theme build in locale `en`
- **THEN** each has the skip link, the site title, the site header with the four navigation links in order and then `form.site-search`, one `main#main`, the footer text with its `time`, the same on every page, both `meta` elements, exactly one `h1`, no heading-level jump greater than one, and exactly one `input[name=q]`, the header's
- **AND** on every page except `/procedures/`, `/general-procedures/` and the term pages the form's `action` resolves to `/procedures/` and its input has the stated `aria-label` and placeholder

#### Scenario: Term titles use labels and tags
- **WHEN** a test reads `public/reaction_types/aldol-condensation/index.html` and `public/tags/sample-data/index.html` after a theme build in locale `en`
- **THEN** their `h1` texts are `Aldol condensation` and `sample-data`, and their `<title>` texts are `Aldol condensation | OrgSynDB` and `sample-data | OrgSynDB`

#### Scenario: Current section in the navigation
- **WHEN** a test scans the home page, `/procedures/`, a procedure page, the three taxonomy pages, a term page of each taxonomy, `/compounds/`, a compound page, `/sequences/`, a sequence page, the help index and a help page after a theme build
- **THEN** the home page marks no navigation link; `/procedures/` marks its own link with `aria-current="page"`; the procedure page, the three taxonomy pages and the three term pages mark `/procedures/` with `aria-current="true"`; `/compounds/` marks its own link with `page` and the compound page marks it with `true`; `/sequences/` marks its own link with `page` and the sequence page marks it with `true`; `/help/` marks its own link with `page`; and the help page `/help/schema/` marks `/help/` with `true`

#### Scenario: The header does not move between pages
- **WHEN** the orchestrator measures the header and the `h1` of the home page, `/procedures/`, a term page, a procedure page and the help index in a browser at 1280 and at 500 CSS pixels (manual verification, tasks.md section 3)
- **THEN** at each width the header has the same height, the site title, the navigation and the search form the same positions and sizes, and the `h1` the same font size on every page

### Requirement: Metadata panel
The metadata panel SHALL be a `dl.metadata`, the first element of the details wrapper at the start of `article.procedure`. It holds one `dt`/`dd` pair per field, with these labels in this order, each pair present only when the field is set. The panel repeats nothing the procedure header shows: the ID is in the header's ID line, the scale and yields are its key facts, and the checkers of a checked procedure are its sign-off. A compound's name is its shown name (localization "German compound names").
- `Product`, or `Products` when the procedure has several: one `a.compound` per product, in `products` order, linking `/compounds/<key>/` with the compound's name as text, joined by `, `;
- `Formula`, only when the procedure has one product: the compound's formula, where each digit run is wrapped in `<sub>`;
- `MW`, likewise, as `<mw> g/mol`;
- `CAS`, likewise, when the compound sets it;
- `SMILES`, likewise, as a `<code data-smiles>` with the string, followed by `button.copy-button` with `type="button"`, `data-copy-smiles`, the text `Copy` and `hidden`;
- `Starting materials`: one `a.compound` per entry of `substrates`, in its order, linking the compound's page with its name as text, joined by `, `;
- `Reaction type`, as a link to the term page whose text is the vocabulary label;
- `Tags`, as one link per tag to its term page, with the tag as text;
- `Authors`, as one link per author to the author's term page, with the name as text;
- `Checked by`, as the names joined by `, `, not linked, only when the status is not `checked`;
- `Created`, as `<time datetime="<RFC 3339 date>">YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM</time>`;
- `Modified`, the same for `lastmod`;
- `Precursors`, as in the requirement "Precursor and used-in links";
- `Used in`, as in the same requirement;
- `Sequences`, as synthesis-sequences "Sequences beside procedures and compounds" states.

Whitespace separates every `</dt>` from the following `<dd>` in the published HTML.

#### Scenario: Panel of the Markdown seed
- **WHEN** a test scans `procedures/osdb-0002/index.html` after a theme build
- **THEN** the `dt` texts are, in order, `Product`, `Formula`, `MW`, `CAS`, `SMILES`, `Starting materials`, `Reaction type`, `Tags`, `Authors`, `Created`, `Modified`, `Precursors` and `Sequences`
- **AND** the values include an `a.compound` to `/compounds/acetylsalicylic-acid/` with the text `Acetylsalicylic acid`, `C9H8O4` with three `<sub>` elements, `180.16 g/mol`, `50-78-2`, `CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O` in `code[data-smiles]`, `a.compound` links `Salicylic acid` and `Acetic anhydride` under `Starting materials`, a link with text `Acylation`, links `sample-data` and `acetylation`, links `A. Example` and `C. Example`, and `<time datetime="2026-10-19T23:46:11+02:00">`

#### Scenario: Panel labels follow the canonical order on every page
- **WHEN** a test scans every procedure page after a theme build
- **THEN** each page's `dt` texts are a subsequence of the canonical label list in its order, they include every label whose field the content file sets, except `Checked by` where the status is `checked`, with `Product` for one product and `Products` for several, and `Formula`, `MW` and `SMILES` exactly when there is one product, no page has an `ID`, `Scale` or `Yield` label, and whitespace follows every `</dt>`

#### Scenario: A product named like its procedure is linked
- **WHEN** a test scans `procedures/osdb-0001/index.html`, whose title and product name are both `Salicylic acid`, after a theme build
- **THEN** its panel's `Product` pair holds one `a.compound` to `/compounds/salicylic-acid/` with the text `Salicylic acid`

#### Scenario: Panel of a procedure with two products
- **WHEN** a test scans `procedures/osdb-0907/index.html` after the two-product build of the requirement "Procedure page structure"
- **THEN** its panel has a `Products` pair with the `a.compound` links `trans-Stilbene` and `cis-Stilbene`, in that order, and no `Product`, `Formula`, `MW`, `CAS` or `SMILES` pair

### Requirement: Compound pages
The site SHALL publish, for every compound of the registry, a page at `/compounds/<key>/`, made by a Hugo content adapter in `site/content/compounds/` from `site.Data.compounds` (site-build "Hugo configuration"). The page's display title is the compound's shown name (localization "German compound names"), and its `main` holds, in this order:
- the `h1` with that name;
- when the compound sets `structure_image`, a `figure.structure` holding an `img` whose `src` resolves to the published image and whose `alt` is `Structure of <name>`; otherwise no figure and no placeholder;
- a `dl.compound-facts` with the pairs `Formula`, `MW`, `CAS` (only when set) and `SMILES`, written as the metadata panel writes them, the SMILES with its copy button, and whitespace after each `</dt>`;
- `section.compound-made-by`, only when some published procedure has the compound among its products, with the `h2` `Made by` and a `ul` holding one `li` per such procedure, by ID, or, for a general procedure, one per entry that makes the compound, in entry order: an `a` linking the procedure page with the text `<ID> <title>`, then, for a general procedure, ` · entry <n>`, then ` · `, the yield of this compound in that procedure or entry as `<n> %`, then ` · ` and the procedure's status badge;
- `section.compound-used-in`, only when some published procedure has the compound among its `substrates`, with the `h2` `Used in` and a `ul` holding one `li` per such procedure, by ID: an `a` linking the procedure page with the text `<ID> <title>`, then ` · ` and its status badge.

- `section.compound-sequences`, as synthesis-sequences "Sequences beside procedures and compounds" states.

A compound page carries no `data-pagefind-body`, so the search index holds procedures only, and it loads no script but `site.js`.

#### Scenario: A page per compound
- **WHEN** a test scans `public/compounds/` after a theme build in locale `en`
- **THEN** every key of the test collection's registry has a page `compounds/<key>/index.html` whose `h1` is the compound's `name` and whose facts equal the registry's values, and no other compound page exists

#### Scenario: Made by and used in
- **WHEN** a test reads the pages of `salicylic-acid` and `methyl-salicylate` after the same build
- **THEN** the first's `Made by` list holds OSDB-0001 with `80 %` and its `Used in` list holds OSDB-0002
- **AND** the second has no `section.compound-made-by`, and its `Used in` list holds OSDB-0001

#### Scenario: Made by an entry of a general procedure
- **WHEN** a test reads the page of `1-biphenyl-4-yl-ethanol` after the same build
- **THEN** its `Made by` list holds OSDB-0005 with `90 %`, and the demo's general procedure with ` · entry 1 · ` and that entry's yield

#### Scenario: Compound pages are not indexed
- **WHEN** a test scans every compound page after the same build
- **THEN** none has an element with `data-pagefind-body`, and the image of `isopentyl-acetate` resolves to `public/structures/isopentyl-acetate.svg`

### Requirement: Home page
The home page's `main` SHALL contain, in this order:
- `div.home-intro`, holding the `h1` `Synthetic procedures` and a `p.lede` with the text `The group's procedures, written in Org or Markdown to one schema.`;
- `div.home-layout`, holding, in this order:
  - `section.home-recent`, with the `h2` `Recently updated`, then an `ol.recent-list` with one `li` per procedure for the first five published procedures, or all when there are fewer, ordered by `lastmod` as an instant, newest first, and by `id` ascending for equal instants. Each `li` holds an `a` linking the procedure page whose text is `<id> <title>`, then `<time datetime="<RFC 3339 lastmod>">YYYY-MM-DD</time>`. After the list, a `p` links `/procedures/?sort=modified` with the text `All procedures, recently updated first`;
  - `section.home-unchecked`, only when some published procedure has the status `draft`, with the `h2` `Not yet checked`, then an `ol.unchecked-list` with one `li` per draft for the first five drafts by `id` ascending, or all when there are fewer: the drafts the catalogue lists first under `/procedures/?status=draft`. Each `li` holds an `a` linking the procedure page whose text is `<id> <title>`, then `<time datetime="<RFC 3339 date>">YYYY-MM-DD</time>` of its creation. After the list, a `p` holds a link to `/procedures/?status=draft` with the text `All draft procedures`, then ` ` and a `span.count` reading `(<n>)`, `n` the number of drafts;
  - `section.home-browse`, with the `h2` `Browse`, then a `ul.browse-list` whose `li` entries hold, in this order, a link and then ` ` and a `span.count` reading `(<n>)`: `All procedures` to `/procedures/`, `n` the number of published procedures; `Reaction types` to `/reaction_types/`, `Tags` to `/tags/` and `Authors` to `/authors/`, each `n` the number of terms of that taxonomy in use; `Compounds` to `/compounds/`, `n` the number of compounds in the registry; `Sequences` to `/sequences/`, `n` the number of published sequences.

The counts are computed from the published procedures and the registry, and written with the site language's digit grouping. The home page's `main` holds no form, no `input` and no procedure table. On screen, from 70rem up, the recent and unchecked lists form the first column and the browse list the second.

#### Scenario: Home page content
- **WHEN** a test scans `public/index.html` of a theme build that adds the catalogue fixtures to the test collection, in locale `en`
- **THEN** the `h1` is `Synthetic procedures`, and the recent list holds the first five procedures in the computed order, each ID once, with the stated link texts and dates, and two fixtures whose `lastmod` is the same instant are ordered by ID
- **AND** the unchecked list holds the first five drafts by ID with their creation dates, and its link reads the number of drafts computed from the published content files
- **AND** the browse list has the six entries in order, with the stated targets, and counts equal to those computed from the published content files and the registry
- **AND** `main` has the links to `/procedures/?sort=modified` and `/procedures/?status=draft`, and no `form`, `input` or `table`

#### Scenario: Nothing waits for a check
- **WHEN** a test scans `public/index.html` of a theme build of a collection whose procedures are all `checked`
- **THEN** it has no `section.home-unchecked` and no link to `/procedures/?status=draft`

### Requirement: Content does not need JavaScript
Every procedure, catalogue, taxonomy, term, compound, sequence, help and home page SHALL show all of its content without running JavaScript. Scripts add only these:
- `site/assets/js/site.js` reveals and wires the print button (`window.print()`) and the SMILES copy button.
- `site.js` replaces the print-facts URL with `location.href` when the protocol is `http:` or `https:`.
- The copy button writes the SMILES string with the Clipboard API. When that fails or is unavailable, it selects the SMILES text instead.
- The catalogue script, on the catalogue and term pages, reveals the catalogue's controls and runs its search, filters, sorting and views (site-catalogue).

In the published HTML, the print button (`data-print`) and the SMILES copy button (`data-copy-smiles`) carry `hidden`, and only `site.js` reveals them. No other button carries `hidden`. Every button of a catalogue lies inside an element that carries `data-catalogue-controls` and `hidden`, which only the catalogue script reveals. The header search's submit button is visible and works without JavaScript.

#### Scenario: Static HTML holds the content
- **WHEN** a test scans every procedure page after a theme build, without running scripts
- **THEN** the metadata values, the rendered body sections and the links are present in the HTML, every `button` with `data-print` or `data-copy-smiles` has the `hidden` attribute, and no other `button` on any page under `public/` has it
- **AND** every `button` of a page's `div.catalogue` lies inside an element with `data-catalogue-controls` and `hidden`

#### Scenario: Buttons work in a browser
- **WHEN** the orchestrator opens a procedure page in a browser with JavaScript (manual verification, tasks.md section 6)
- **THEN** the print button is visible and opens the print dialog, the Copy button copies or selects the SMILES string, and with JavaScript disabled neither button is shown and the page is otherwise unchanged
- **AND** with JavaScript disabled, submitting the header search of a procedure page loads `/procedures/?q=<term>`, which shows the `noscript` note and every procedure by ID, and no catalogue control
