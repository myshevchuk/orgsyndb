## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Web server and Compose file
`deploy/docker/Caddyfile` SHALL serve `/var/lib/orgsyndb/current/public` with `file_server` at the site address `ORGSYNDB_ADDRESS`, `:8080` by default, `/pdf/` from `current/pdf` with a directory listing, answer `404` for every path beginning with `/lab/collection/manifest`, forward `/lab/` and every other path below it, unchanged, to the application at `ORGSYNDB_APP_UPSTREAM`, `app:8000` by default, and forward every path below `/git/`, with `/git` taken off, to Forgejo at `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_UPSTREAM`, `forge:3000` by default, redirecting `/git` to `/git/`. It sets the header `Cache-Control: no-cache` on every response but Forgejo's, which sets its own, and turns Caddy's admin endpoint off.

`deploy/compose.yaml` SHALL define these services, each reading `orgsyndb.env`:

- `builder`, running `orgsyndb-deploy run` with an init process and `ORGSYNDB_LAB=true` in its environment, so that the site it builds links the lab application's views, and `web`, running Caddy with port 8080 published, both from one image built from `deploy/docker` with the build arguments `APP_REPO` and `APP_REF`, both mounting the volume `data` at `/var/lib/orgsyndb`, read-only for `web`;
- `db`, from `postgres:18`, keeping its data in the volume `db`, with a health check by `pg_isready`;
- `app`, from the image built from the repository root with `deploy/webapp/Dockerfile`, mounting `data` read-only at `/var/lib/orgsyndb` and starting once `db` is healthy;
- `backup`, from `postgres:18`, running `deploy/backup/orgsyndb-backup`, mounted read-only, with `deploy/backups/` mounted at `/backups`;
- `forge-db` and `forge` (Forgejo).

`deploy/orgsyndb.env.example` lists the settings, among them `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, the matching `ORGSYNDB_DATABASE_URL`, `ORGSYNDB_SECRET_KEY`, with how to generate a key, `ORGSYNDB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, with `app` among the hosts, `ORGSYNDB_BUILDER_TOKEN`, with how to generate a token, and the settings of Forgejo with how to generate each secret. Git ignores `deploy/orgsyndb.env` and `deploy/backups/`.

#### Scenario: Caddyfile
- **WHEN** a test reads the Caddyfile, and runs `caddy adapt` on it when Caddy is installed
- **THEN** it names `/var/lib/orgsyndb/current/public`, the `Cache-Control` header, `/lab/*`, `reverse_proxy`, `/lab/collection/manifest*`, answered with `404` ahead of the `/lab/*` route, and `/git/*` with `handle_path`, and adapts without error

#### Scenario: Compose file
- **WHEN** a test copies `deploy/` with `orgsyndb.env.example` as `orgsyndb.env` and runs `docker compose config`, skipping without Docker
- **THEN** it succeeds, the services are `builder`, `web`, `db`, `app`, `backup`, `forge-db` and `forge`, `builder` runs `orgsyndb-deploy run`, reads the settings and has `ORGSYNDB_LAB` set to `true`, `web` and `app` mount the data volume read-only, `db`'s health check runs `pg_isready`, `app` depends on `db` being healthy, and `app` receives the example's `ORGSYNDB_DATABASE_URL`

### Requirement: Application image
`deploy/webapp/Dockerfile` SHALL build an image from `fedora:44` that installs Python 3 and uv, copies `webapp/` and `site/assets/css/` from the build context, the repository root, installs the locked dependencies without the development ones, and collects the static files. It runs as the user `orgsyndb` with UID 1000 and exposes port 8000. Its command applies pending migrations, then runs `manage.py demo_data --if-empty`, which seeds an empty database when `ORGSYNDB_DEMO` is true and otherwise changes nothing (lab-demo "Demo data command"), then `manage.py forge_client`, which registers Forgejo as the OpenID client when its secret is set (web-app "OpenID provider"), and then serves `orgsyndb_web.wsgi` with gunicorn on `0.0.0.0:8000`. `deploy/orgsyndb.env.example` names `ORGSYNDB_DEMO`, commented out, with a comment saying that it fills an empty database with invented records whose accounts share a password shown on the sign-in page, and is for test deployments only.

#### Scenario: Image inputs
- **WHEN** a test reads `deploy/webapp/Dockerfile`
- **THEN** it names `fedora:44`, `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`, `collectstatic`, `migrate`, `demo_data --if-empty`, `forge_client` and `gunicorn`, in the command in the order `migrate`, `demo_data`, `forge_client`, `gunicorn`, and `USER orgsyndb`

#### Scenario: Demo flag in the example settings
- **WHEN** a test reads `deploy/orgsyndb.env.example`
- **THEN** it holds the line `#ORGSYNDB_DEMO=false`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Forgejo
`deploy/compose.yaml` SHALL run Forgejo as `forge`, from `codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo:15.0.11-rootless`, keeping its data in the volume `forge`, with port 2222, its SSH server, published, starting once `forge-db` has completed. Its settings come from environment variables, none from a hand-edited file and none substituted by Compose from the shell: as constants in `compose.yaml`, the PostgreSQL database `forge` on `db` as the role `forge`, the installation locked, registration only through an external source, an account created at the first sign-in through one, named by the `nickname` claim, no linking to an existing account, no password sign-in form and the built-in SSH server on port 2222; and, from `orgsyndb.env` at start, the root URL `<ORGSYNDB_URL>/git/` and the database password `FORGE_DB_PASSWORD`, which `deploy/forge/forge-start`, mounted read-only and run as the service's entrypoint, exports before it runs the image's own entrypoint.

`forge-db`, from `postgres:18`, runs once after `db` is healthy and creates the role `forge` with `FORGE_DB_PASSWORD` and the database `forge` it owns when either is missing, so that a database volume made before gains them; it changes nothing that exists.

`deploy/forge/forge-setup`, mounted read-only into `forge` as well and run with `docker compose exec forge`, creates the admin account `orgsyndb` with `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_PASSWORD` when it is missing, and adds or updates the OpenID Connect source `lab` with the discovery URL `${ORGSYNDB_APP_INTERNAL_URL}/lab/o/.well-known/openid-configuration`, the client id `forgejo`, `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET` and the scopes `openid profile email`; run again it changes only what differs. `deploy/orgsyndb.env.example` names `ORGSYNDB_URL`, the address people reach the site at; `ORGSYNDB_OIDC_KEY`, with the command that generates it; `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_PASSWORD` and `FORGE_DB_PASSWORD`, each with how to generate it; and `ORGSYNDB_FORGE_URL`, `http://forge:3000/api/v1` by default.

#### Scenario: Forgejo's service
- **WHEN** a test runs `docker compose config` as in Compose file
- **THEN** with no `ORGSYNDB_` or `FORGE_` variable in the shell, `forge` uses the pinned image, has `forge-start` as its entrypoint, mounts the volume `forge`, publishes 2222, depends on `forge-db` completing, and its environment sets the database `forge` on `db`, `ENABLE_AUTO_REGISTRATION`, `ACCOUNT_LINKING` `disabled` and `ENABLE_INTERNAL_SIGNIN` `false`, and the output holds no unresolved or empty substitution; `forge-db` depends on `db` being healthy and does not restart

#### Scenario: The start script
- **WHEN** a test runs `deploy/forge/forge-start` with `ORGSYNDB_URL=http://localhost:8080` and `FORGE_DB_PASSWORD=x` in its environment and a stand-in for the image's entrypoint
- **THEN** the stand-in runs with `FORGEJO__server__ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080/git/` and `FORGEJO__database__PASSWD=x` in its environment

#### Scenario: Creating the database once
- **WHEN** a test runs `forge-db`'s script against a PostgreSQL server twice, skipping without one
- **THEN** after the first run the role and the database `forge` exist, and the second run succeeds and changes nothing

#### Scenario: The set-up script
- **WHEN** a test reads `deploy/forge/forge-setup`
- **THEN** it creates the admin `orgsyndb` only when missing, and adds the source `lab` when missing and updates it otherwise, with the discovery URL, the client id `forgejo` and the scopes `openid profile email`
