## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Web server and Compose file
`deploy/docker/Caddyfile` SHALL serve `/var/lib/orgsyndb/current/public` with `file_server` at the site address `ORGSYNDB_ADDRESS`, `:8080` by default, `/pdf/` from `current/pdf` with a directory listing, and forward `/lab/` and every path below it, unchanged, to the application at `ORGSYNDB_APP_UPSTREAM`, `app:8000` by default. It sets the header `Cache-Control: no-cache` on every response and turns Caddy's admin endpoint off.

`deploy/compose.yaml` SHALL define these services, each reading `orgsyndb.env`:

- `builder`, running `orgsyndb-deploy run` with an init process and `ORGSYNDB_LAB=true` in its environment, so that the site it builds links the lab application's views, and `web`, running Caddy with port 8080 published, both from one image built from `deploy/docker` with the build arguments `APP_REPO` and `APP_REF`, both mounting the volume `data` at `/var/lib/orgsyndb`, read-only for `web`;
- `db`, from `postgres:18`, keeping its data in the volume `db`, with a health check by `pg_isready`;
- `app`, from the image built from the repository root with `deploy/webapp/Dockerfile`, mounting `data` read-only at `/var/lib/orgsyndb` and starting once `db` is healthy;
- `backup`, from `postgres:18`, running `deploy/backup/orgsyndb-backup`, mounted read-only, with `deploy/backups/` mounted at `/backups`.

`deploy/orgsyndb.env.example` lists the settings, among them `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`, the matching `ORGSYNDB_DATABASE_URL`, `ORGSYNDB_SECRET_KEY`, with how to generate a key, and `ORGSYNDB_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Git ignores `deploy/orgsyndb.env` and `deploy/backups/`.

#### Scenario: Caddyfile
- **WHEN** a test reads the Caddyfile, and runs `caddy adapt` on it when Caddy is installed
- **THEN** it names `/var/lib/orgsyndb/current/public`, the `Cache-Control` header, `/lab/*` and `reverse_proxy`, and adapts without error

#### Scenario: Compose file
- **WHEN** a test copies `deploy/` with `orgsyndb.env.example` as `orgsyndb.env` and runs `docker compose config`, skipping without Docker
- **THEN** it succeeds, the services are `builder`, `web`, `db`, `app` and `backup`, `builder` runs `orgsyndb-deploy run`, reads the settings and has `ORGSYNDB_LAB` set to `true`, `web` and `app` mount the data volume read-only, `db`'s health check runs `pg_isready`, `app` depends on `db` being healthy, and `app` receives the example's `ORGSYNDB_DATABASE_URL`
