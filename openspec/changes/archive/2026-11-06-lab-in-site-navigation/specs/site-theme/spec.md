## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Page shell
Every HTML page the theme renders SHALL contain, in this order:
- a skip link `a.skip-link` with `href="#main"`;
- a `header.site-header` holding, in this order:
  - `a.site-title`, linking `/` with the text `OrgSynDB`;
  - a `nav` element carrying `aria-label="Site"`, which links, in this order, to `/compounds/`, `/sequences/`, `/procedures/` and `/help/`, with the texts `Compounds`, `Sequences`, `Procedures` and `Help`. On a site built with the lab application's views (site-build "Hugo configuration") these links follow links to `/lab/inventory/end-products/`, `/lab/planning/` and `/lab/tasks/`, with the texts `Inventory`, `Planning` and `Tasks`. The header holds no other `nav`;
  - `form.site-search` with `role="search"` and `method="get"`, holding one `input` with `type="search"` and `name="q"`, and a `button` with `type="submit"` and the text `Search`. On the catalogue, the term pages and `/general-procedures/` it is the catalogue's search form, with the `action`, attributes and texts that site-catalogue "Catalogue controls" gives, and on `/compounds/` and its tab pages it is the compound catalogue's, as site-catalogue "Compound catalogue" and "Compound tabs" give. On every other page its `action` resolves to `/procedures/`, and its input carries `aria-label="Search procedures"` and the placeholder `Product, CAS, SMILES or keyword`;
- exactly one `main` element with `id="main"`;
- a `footer.site-footer` whose text is `OrgSynDB · internal procedures · built <time>`, where `<time>` is a `time` element whose `datetime` is the time the site was built, as an RFC 3339 date-time, and whose text is that time as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`. Every page of one build shows the same time.

The navigation link whose URL is the page's own URL carries `aria-current="page"`. Otherwise the link of the section the page lies in carries `aria-current="true"`: every procedure page, `/general-procedures/`, `/reaction_types/`, `/tags/`, `/authors/` and their term pages lie in `/procedures/`; every compound page and every compound tab page lies in `/compounds/`; every sequence page lies in `/sequences/`; every help page lies in `/help/`. No other navigation link carries `aria-current`. Every page has exactly one `input` with `name="q"`: the header's.

On screen, the site title and the navigation sit at the start of the header row and the search form at its end, so that the header has the same height, and its title, navigation and search form the same positions, on every page at a given window width. Every page's `h1` has the same font size.

These texts are those of an English site; a German site has the German texts that the localization spec gives.

Each page's head has a `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` and a `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">`. The site-build "Minimal layout contract" elements also stay: `lang`, `charset` and `<title>`.

Headings follow these rules:
- Each page has exactly one `h1`.
- No heading is more than one level deeper than the heading before it.
- The `<title>` is the page's display title followed by ` | OrgSynDB`, except on the home page, whose title is `OrgSynDB`. The display title is the vocabulary label on a reaction-type term page, the tag itself on a tag term page, the interface string named by the page's `title_key` where it has one, and the page title otherwise.

#### Scenario: Shell on every page
- **WHEN** a test scans every HTML file under `public/` except files under `public/pagefind/`, after a theme build in locale `en`
- **THEN** each has the skip link, the site title, the site header with the four navigation links in order and then `form.site-search`, one `main#main`, the footer text with its `time`, the same on every page, both `meta` elements, exactly one `h1`, no heading-level jump greater than one, and exactly one `input[name=q]`, the header's
- **AND** on every page except `/procedures/`, `/general-procedures/`, `/compounds/`, its tab pages and the term pages the form's `action` resolves to `/procedures/` and its input has the stated `aria-label` and placeholder

#### Scenario: Term titles use labels and tags
- **WHEN** a test reads `public/reaction_types/aldol-condensation/index.html` and `public/tags/sample-data/index.html` after a theme build in locale `en`
- **THEN** their `h1` texts are `Aldol condensation` and `sample-data`, and their `<title>` texts are `Aldol condensation | OrgSynDB` and `sample-data | OrgSynDB`

#### Scenario: Current section in the navigation
- **WHEN** a test scans the home page, `/procedures/`, a procedure page, the three taxonomy pages, a term page of each taxonomy, `/compounds/`, a compound page, `/sequences/`, a sequence page, the help index and a help page after a theme build
- **THEN** the home page marks no navigation link; `/procedures/` marks its own link with `aria-current="page"`; the procedure page, the three taxonomy pages and the three term pages mark `/procedures/` with `aria-current="true"`; `/compounds/` marks its own link with `page` and the compound page marks it with `true`; `/sequences/` marks its own link with `page` and the sequence page marks it with `true`; `/help/` marks its own link with `page`; and the help page `/help/schema/` marks `/help/` with `true`

#### Scenario: The header does not move between pages
- **WHEN** the orchestrator measures the header and the `h1` of the home page, `/procedures/`, a term page, a procedure page and the help index in a browser at 1280 and at 500 CSS pixels (manual verification, tasks.md section 3)
- **THEN** at each width the header has the same height, the site title, the navigation and the search form the same positions and sizes, and the `h1` the same font size on every page

#### Scenario: Lab views in the navigation
- **WHEN** a test builds a collection in locale `en` with the lab application's views and once without them, and reads the home page and a procedure page of each build
- **THEN** with them each page's `nav` lists `Inventory`, `Planning`, `Tasks`, `Compounds`, `Sequences`, `Procedures` and `Help` in that order, the first three linking `/lab/inventory/end-products/`, `/lab/planning/` and `/lab/tasks/` and none of them carrying `aria-current`; without them it lists the last four only, and no link of the header leads under `/lab/`
